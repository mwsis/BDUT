# FAQs: <!-- omit in toc -->

## Q1: "How do I build BDUT?"

Because it is a 1-file header-only library, you do not need to build.

In a forthcoming release we will provide a **CMake**-based mechanism for installing.


## Q2: "Does BDUT have its own unit-tests?"

Although it does not yet, it will do so. However, because it is a unit-test library itself, those tests failed deliberately in order to illustrate the outputs given when you use **BDUT** in your own work.
