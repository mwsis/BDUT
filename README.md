## Introduction

**B**rain-**D**ead **U**nit-**T**esting, is a very simple - simplistic, in fact - small, header-only, standalone library for C and C++. Its intent is to be bundled into other projects for which it is not desired to couple to a more sophisticated library.


## Installation

### CMake installation

Currently, **CMake** support is not yet provided.


### Manual installation

Since **BDUT** is intended to be bundled into other open-source libraries, the simplest way to use it is to add a directory **bdut** under your project's **include** directory, into which you can then simply copy **bdut.h**.


## Examples
